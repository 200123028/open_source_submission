## **WHAT FACINATES ME IN CODING...**

I am genuinely excited by the prospect of me delving into `Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence`, the countless possibilites that it poses in each and every up and coming field is truly something to marvel at.
<br>

`Competitve Learning`  fascinates me because it always sharpens one's logical and analytical skills and makes me develop a deeper sense of respect for a more efficient and faster code.
<br>

I also believe being skillful at `Open Source` is crucial to collabarating over and updating your projects and maintiang them over time, in today's world it would be a pre-requisite for any good programmer or coder or developer.
<br>

`Developing` apps and websites and knowing that there is somebody out there using something you made has a sense of achievement that can't be matched. Development is truly exciting and creating a website or an app that stands out in the or reaches out to people in today's internet driven world has a sense of fulfilment to it.

>I like 
**coding** 
in general beacuse of these reasons and really look forward to being able to do more in it.
