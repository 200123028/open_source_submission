### Coding Tastes
I had quite a taste for **CP** in the 11th and 12th standard, when we were taught *C++* at school. I loved playing around with the code and also learned fun things outside the scope of my syllabus. Tried my hand at graphics using Turbo C++ (1990's graphics :P).
Until last year, when I started doing a course in *HTML5 and CSS3*, my interest shifted to **WebD**. The course is currently nearing completion and I am really excited to get my hands dirty in building real-world websites.
### Coding Endeavours
1. Built a program in **Turbo C++** simulating a game of cricket in 11th standard. It works on the basis of the **random() function**. It doesn't quite work well in other IDEs except Turbo C3. Here's the link to the project: [Cricket in C++](https://github.com/noeltom787/Cricket-in-CPP)
2. Nothing else :)
