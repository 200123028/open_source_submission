### C++ for SUM of ACSII values :

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
 
// creating function for ascii value conversion
long long to_Ascii(char ch)
{
    return (long long)(ch);
}
int main()
{
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    string s;
    cout<<"Enter your full name : ";
    getline(cin,s); // getting a sentence as input
    long long sum = 0;
    for(long long i =0;i<s.length();i++)
    {
        if(s[i]!=' ')
        {
            sum += to_Ascii(s[i]); 
        }
    }
    cout<<"SUM of ASCII values of your FULL NAME is = "<<sum<<endl;
    return 0;
}

### Interests and Explorations!

1. **Open Source** : Simply coding for a night long doesn't give that goosebumps at all until we get introduced to how they are being used by companies to build a real world project. Open source has always fascinated me to look through the edges and have a glance at how other people are approaching a similar kind of project which I am doing now. I hope my thirst to solve real world problems certainly gets reflected in my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/ankit11hab) too. 
<br>

2. **Competitive Coding** : Getting a place in some fast-paced coding contests has always been my dream for years. I have started CP in the middle of my first semester and at this moment I am 5 star in C++ at [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/a_guha1) and 1524 rated coder at [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/users/ankit11hab).
<br>

3. **Design** : This is a field which I want to explore and have recently developed interests for. I am in the group of SWC design and am completing the tasks regularly.
<br>

4. **Web Development** : Web Development has been the greatest reason that pulled me into the world of coding. I have made several projects as a front-end developer and have been working as an associate web developer at SoftechInfo pvt. ltd. since the beginning of my first year. Some of my projects include: <br>
    - **[myboloo.com](myboloo.com)** : An website exclusively for CST Freshers.
    - **[https://cbcarronbiotech.com/](https://cbcarronbiotech.com/)** : A medical website
