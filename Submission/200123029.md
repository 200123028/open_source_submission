# About Me
I started coding after JEE A, with C++.

The modules in which I am interested are:-

## 1.Open Source-
   I really like the idea of open source that developers all over the world can contribute for the community, and this has really resulted in
   some great projects, and the one which I like the most is Google Chrome. Even I aspire to start contributing towards Open Source soon!

## 2.Competitive Coding
  I am interested in mathematics and problem solving and also like competitive tasks. CP provides me all that. Currently I practice problems and give contests on Codeforces and   Codechef.

## 3. Web D
  As a kid, I was fascinated by internet websites, and really wanted to know how they work and are made. Currently, I have basic knowledge of HTML,CSS and Bootstrap.
## 4.Machine Learning
  I play chess a lot and that's how I got interested about ML. I closely follow recent ML developments and also want to explore this field, and have started learning Python for the same.

  As such I do not have any noticeable achievements in the field of coding, but am in the learning process.
