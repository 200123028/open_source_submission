> ## **CODE :**

A small program to calculate the sum of ASCII values in my name :)

```cpp

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    string name = "Grace Mary Matson";
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < name.length(); i++)
    {
        if (name.at(i) != ' ')
            sum += name.at(i);
    }
    cout << "The sum of the ASCII values of the characters in my name " << name << " is = " << sum;
    return 0;
}

```

> ## **Which areas in coding fascinate me ?**

1. Machine Learning and Data Science: love analysing data and making inferences, have taken courses on it as well as surveys, have not made my hands too dirty yet, but I surely will in the near future.

2. Competitive programming: I like putting myself under pressure to build logic under time constraint. Although it intrigues me, I still am in the building confidence level.

3. Web development and App development: It's an area I'm interested in for sure. I am keen on getting my hands dirty in this too.
