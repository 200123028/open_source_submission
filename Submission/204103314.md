### C++ program which gives SUM of ASCII values of my FULLNAME.
```cpp
#include <iostream>


int main(){
    char full_name[] = "Mayank Pathania";

    int i{0};
    int ascii_sum{0};
    while(full_name[i]) ascii_sum += full_name[i++];

    std::cout << ascii_sum << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

### Interest in Different Fields of Coding
I'm interested in competitive coding, Data Science and Machine Learning. As I have recently started journey of coding I'm still gaining the skills. I solve coding problem daily and seldom take part in competitive coding. I have completed some courses related to data science on Coursera and it was fun analyzing data through plots and statistics. Through an elective Course (ME674: Soft Computing) I got to work on neural networks and the idea of training a model and then predicting results was very interesting. Currently, I'm enrolled in a course on Machine Learning by Henry Harvin and it's very informative.

### Achievements (not related to coding)
1. Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering, 2019, Secured All India rank of 1201 (Mechanical Engineering).
2. Bronze Medal, Inter club Karate Championship 2017, organized by Dhauladhar Karate Club, Dharamshala.
