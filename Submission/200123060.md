### Interests

- I like **Competitive Programming** because I like problem solving and also because it is a relatively new field for me. 
- I also have a keen interest in **Machine Learning** and Artificial Intelligence.
- And lastly I'm the most interested in **App Development** because it helps me solve day to day problems.
- I have proficiency in C++, Java and Python. In Java I can use NetBeams to develop simple interfaces. I have familiarity with MySQL and how it can be linked with Java to store data.

### Achievements

1. **App Development Project**: I developed a complete GUI based solution for Hotel Management that involves Java (NetBeans) as the frontend and MySQL as the backend DBMS. It can add, remove, modify, and search (MySQL queries) customers or rooms. A repository can be seen on [Github](https://github.com/subhamhimself/Hotel-Management) or you have a look at the [ReadMe](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CfvxqCzch_146K4ilTLt2OIOsYIzwa7l/view?usp=sharing) pdf. A ReadMe doc file is also available on GitHub.
