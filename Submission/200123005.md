Before joining college, I had no prior experience of coding. But just after a few days of joining, I came to know about the CP thing. I found it very interesting and completely Logic based. So, I started learning new concepts, and practicing questions from the web. That's how I gained interest in CP. Also, I wanted to learn more about Web Development, and Yeahh!!, Thanks to **Coding week**, I got the opportunity to try my hands on Web D.
