## My Interests
I love exploring and learning different tech stacks, and enjoy learning various algorithms.
1) Open source - I Want to explore this field, working on large code bases excites me.
2) Competitive coding - I enjoy giving contests on online sites, and always look forward to learn ds-Algo. My codeforces handle - dkgoutham
3) App development - Recently I started learning Flutter, and looking forward make projects using this tech stack.
4) Machine learning - I went through the machine learning sources given by the coding club, which ignited some interest towards this field in me. Looking forward to learn more about Machine Learning.
