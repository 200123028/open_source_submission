I have been introduced to the field of coding as early as 8th grade, when I came accross Java in BlueJ envireonment and learnt the basics of coding from printing series and sequences to sorting arrays . Even prior to that, I have learnt langages like QBasic and HTML in school. In the higher secondary years, I have been introduced to C++ and have learnt the language extensively. I am keen on learning more as this field has always intrigued and interested me.
