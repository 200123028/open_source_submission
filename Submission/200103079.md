#### A Little About Me


I first started coding in HTML in grade 8 and picked up a bit of python in grade 11. Learnt a bit of C++ after 12th and did a little bit of competitive programming after watching William Lin on youtube. Really excited on working on open source projects with an amazing team. So far, I have only contributed to a couple of my friends' repositories and done a few small projects. Got into Machine Learning and data analysis after entering college and started a little bit of web development last week by relearning HTML. 


##### Achievements

1. Came 15th in Codepunk.
2. Looking to add more.


Looking forward to working with you guys!
