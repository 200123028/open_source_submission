###Interests 
Even though all the domains of coding are equally interesting and are new/strange seeming to me, after thinking for at least 3 minutes I have came to the conclusion that I found the field related to AI and a bit of animetronics are of my greatest interest and I despise game dev and front end web dev.


####Achievements
