## **WHAT FACINATES ME IN CODING...**

I am quite interested in `ML and AI`.The way it is used in today era quite facinates and motivates me to dive deep into it and learn more and more about it.
`Competitive` also excites me as it constantly helps me develop my logical thinking skills and also helps to approach to a problem statement efficiently and quickly within the given time interval.
`Open source` is a very great concept that helps us to wet our hands in real life problem and helps us to contribute into different fields.Either improve other's code or learn from it.Thus we should try to increase and enhance open source culture more and more.
Coming to `development` part,it also facinates me as it helps us to build and learn about the apps and website that we use in day to day life.If we get a chance to make the games that we play then what would we better than that.Thus overall coding is quite interesting and each field on its own is motivating and facinatting.
