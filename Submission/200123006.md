In my school life, my interest in coding kept on rising as I learnt HTML (in classes 7 & 8), arduino programming (class 10) and C++(11 & 12). Being a huge fan of mathematics and logic, I really started liking coding, making small-scale projects at school-level and beyond.

 After JEE advanced, I started competitive programming and I have really enjoyed it thoroughly.

 I am deeply interested in machine learning, app development and web development, although I have little knowledge in these fields.

 As such, I don't have any achievements in the field of coding.
