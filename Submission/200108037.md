### Interests



1. **CP** - I like the art of problemsolving and CP is all about  problemsolving by using  various interesting techniques. I regularly solve questions and give contests on platforms such as codeforces , codechef and atcoder. 

2. **App Development** - Everyone uses android apps all the time , so the idea of making my own app really intrigued me therefore I started to learn AppD. I use Android Studio to make apps.I know how to code in XML to create different views( text , image , button) and simultaneously use JAVA to create the actual working of the app and make it interactive.

3. **Open Source** -  I really like the idea of contributing to a real world project and code for a real purpose . I have little experience here but I like the idea behind it.
### Achievements
1. I have a **4 star profile** at Hackerrank and my current rating is **1268(Pupil)** at codeforces.

2. Made simple android apps using Android Studio such as :-  
   - **Coffee Ordering App** ( An app that takes in orders and prints the total price) 
   - **Court Counter App**  (An app that simulates the score for a game of BasketBall ,   simultaneously for two teams)
   - **Quiz App** (Used to simulate MCQ Quizzes) 

3. I have proficiency in C++ and have intermediate proficiency in JAVA ; I also know a bit of HTML and XML.
