### **INTERESTS**
  - **Competetive Coding** : I love engaging myself in solving mathematical problems using programming. I have a deep interest in learning and implementing various Data Structures and Algorithms and I have been doing so for the past few months, employing those concepts to solve more riveting and challenging problems.
  
  - **Web Development** : I have some experience with front-end web development. Currently I am expanding my knowledge of CSS and learning Django web framework for the back-end.
  
Apart from the above mentioned fields, I would further like to explore the fields of Machine Learning and App Development.
