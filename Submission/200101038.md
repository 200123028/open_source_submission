## My interests in Programming

I enjoy learning new tech stacks and always exploring what's out there. In terms of programming languages I am familiar with, I know C++, Java, C, Python, Dart, Javascript and HTML CSS (if you consider them as languages :p). But one knows too well that the number doesn't really matter and its the projects/ things you learn that do.

So here are some of my achievements:-

1. I made a COVID-19 Cases tracking web-application using React-js and the mathdro API. [Link to the project](https://github.com/GunjanDhanuka/corona-tracker-app)

2. I made Clima - A weather reporting app as a learning project in Flutter. [Link to the project](https://github.com/GunjanDhanuka/clima-app)

3. I am currently rated Pupil (Rating = 1230) on CodeForces.

4. I took part in the Kharagpur Winter of Code and was also selected to GirlScript Summer of Code. I am passionate towards Open Source and would like to explore further. I had tried applying to GSoC but wasn't successful. I have applied to the MLH Fellowship in Open Source Track.
