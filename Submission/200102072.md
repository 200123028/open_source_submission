## Interests
1. **CP** : I haven't done much, but I like constructing algorithms. There are a lot of aspects I still have to cover, really looking forward to things coming ahead.
2. **APP DEV** : I am really fascinated by the idea of beign able to create something that could be usefull and fun. I started going through the introductory material but couldn't get through much. I'll work on it in the semester break!
