## my interest areas

1. I am yet to explore the different domains in programming.
1. But with a limited intro with some of the fields in the programming, I like Web Development and Open Source the most.
1. I also love to solve mind boggling problems in competitve programming.
1. Though bried enough, but I have a good basic mathematical understaing of Neural Networks and Optimization techniques used in Machine Learning.
