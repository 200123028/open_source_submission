### C++ code to find the ASCII sum of a string

```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;
int main ()
{
    string name;
    int sum = 0; 
    name = "Ankush Patanwal";
    //If user input is required, uncomment the following line
    //cin >> name;
    for (int i = 0; i < name.size(); i++)
    {
        //if <blank space> should not be counted uncomment the following line
        //if(name[i] == ' ') continue;
        sum = sum + name[i];
    }
    cout << sum;
    return 0;
}
```

### Interests

- I have a keen interest in **Machine Learning** and mathematics in general. I loved the course on inferential statistics. I know pandas on python for data manipulation and analysis, NumPy, and scikit-learn fairly well. I also know the math behind some common algorithms like Linear Regression, KNN, SVM, and K-Means Clustering.  
- I also like problem solving, that's why I like **Competitive Programming** and regularly solve problems and give contests on codeforces, gfg (for problems), leetcode, etc.
- I like **open source development** too, as I like to learn from real world situations. Although my involvement in open source development is low, I really like the idea behind open source.  
- I have proficiency in C++ and python, a little bit of HTML and CSS, and started learning Kivy for python gui.

### Achievements

1. ML Related Projects:  
   - Created a linear regression model for predicting final grade based on various parameters of the data set given  

   - Created a K-Nearest Neighbour model for classifying the type of vehicle  

2. Max Codeforces rating: 1367

3. Made a pong game using python and kivy  

4. Created a python script to get wifi passwords of those who run it and emailing it to myself using smtplib (unethical, I know...)
