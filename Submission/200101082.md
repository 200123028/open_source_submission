### Self Description and Achievements:

As an individual, coding has been one of my favourite hobbies since childhood. I started off with Visual Basic and HTML during my 7th grade. However, thanks to JEE preparation, I had to totally give up on my passion to code. Yet, joining in IITG as a CSE student has rekindled that deep within spirit. Currently, I practise and am involved in Competitive Coding, App Development, and Web Development(beginner's level).

I look forward towards Machine Learning and also gaining experience at Open Source (this task has been a big boost)

Achievements:

1. App Developer at a Keet Technology Solutions (a UK based startup)
2. App Developer at Mechanic Guru
3. 5 star profile at HackerRank
4. Keen coder at contests in Codeforces, Codechef, and Atcoder
