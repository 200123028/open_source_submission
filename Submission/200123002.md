## C++ Code to Output Sum of ACSII value of MY FullName :-

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 using namespace std;
 
 int ascii(char c){
     return int(c);
 }

int main(){
    string s;
    cout<<"Enter your full name :- ";
    getline(cin,s);
    int ans = 0;

    for(int i = 0 ; i<s.length() ; i++){
        if(s[i]!=' '){
            ans += ascii(s[i]); 
        }else{continue;}
    }
    cout<<"SUM of ASCII values of MY FULL NAME is "<<ans<<"\n";

## Modules that I am interested in : 

1. **Open Source** :- Open source practices provide us with real world insights. And I find it cool to be able to contribute open source society. 

1. **Competitive Coding** :- I always had an inquisitive mind and the logic involved in CP just caters to it. My growth in CP is slow and steady. I like to build my concepts first and then use them fully.

1. **Machine Learning** :- The idea of making a thing do what u want it to do is just amazing. I have just started learning python as it is necessary for ML.
