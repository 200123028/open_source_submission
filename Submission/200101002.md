_CODE TO FIND SUM OF ASCII VALUES OF MY NAME IN CAPS_

``` C++
#include<bits/stdc++.h>                // header
using namespace std;

int main(){                           // start of main

    string s = "AADI AARYA CHANDRA";    /* can use getline(cin,s); if some other name's ascii value required*/ 
    int sum_ascii=0;
    
    for(auto it : s){
        if(it != ' ')
        {
            sum_ascii += (int)(it);
        }         //incrementing sum if current character is not whitespace
    }
    cout<<sum_ascii<<endl;                   // output answer
    return 0;
}                                          // end of main
```


### INTERESTS IN CODING:

>Having little background in coding got me feeling very interested in a lot of aspects of coding and I hope to learn something about everything and gradually become good at most of them.

1. Competitive Programming
    * It's very interesting.
    * Always been interested in maths, so that helps.
2. Web Development
    * Had learnt a little bit of HTML earlier, but have started learning CSS now.
3. App Development
    * Quite interesting to see how much scope is there in this aspect. Will start learning soon.

4. Open Source
    * Feels like a cool job in the first impression. A lot of new things to learn.
