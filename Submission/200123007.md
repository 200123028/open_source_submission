I started coding during JEE, 2-3 months before JEEA. I love maths, so I coded some programs to find $\pi$, some for different kinds of prime number. So I gained some interest in **CP**. I know a little bit of **Web D** and enthusiastic about learning **ML**. Currently interested in only these 3 areas, but it might change after this coding week.
