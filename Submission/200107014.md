## Interests
1. I have a keen interest in Competitive Coding, and although I am a newbie (only doing HackerRank at this point), I am ready to make efforts to be better in this field.
2. I also have been interested in the field of development. Currently, I am learning Web Development and really enjoying it. In the near future, I am also going to learn App Development
3. I also have an interest in Machine Learning. Although I currently know nothing about it, I am going to learn it in the near future.

## Achievements
1. Not many achievements in coding as I am just a beginner and have just started learning the art of programming and development.
2. The only sort of achievement is that I am 3 star at Hackerrank in C and Python. Although I would love to increase the list in the future.
