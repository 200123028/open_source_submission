***
 The various part of coding I am interested in are:
 1. Web and App Development : I am very much interested to learn to develop to my very own website and app.
 2. Competitive Programming : I also want increase my proficiency in competitive programming so as to improve my problem solving skills
 3. I am also interested to study more about problems involving time complexity and optimisation.
