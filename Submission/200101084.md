## My interests

<br>

1.**open source** :- Open source helps in exploring and learning from various real world projects and problems, Currently trying to make my first contribution.

2.**Competitive Coding** :- the logical problems are always enjoyable, as well as various algorithms help us in understanding the working of the system and to think like a computer, Currently trying to explore and learn the various concepts of CP.

3.**Web Development** :-I am really interested in webD, I wanna learn the backend processes which go on in the background on various websites, I am currently a part of the online module of Technothlon and will contribute in the making of the examination website.

4.**App development** :- I am also exploring app development, currently I have learned some flutter and made a few study projects, I am looking forward to making on some major projects in appD through the coding club.
