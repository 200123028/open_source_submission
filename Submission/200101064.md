***
Coding has always been like a software tool shop for me :). It gives me tools and power to make my computer work in the way I want it to work in, also giving me an in-depth knowledge of how things function indside it. It feels as if I am communicating with it via code :). Although, I am interested in all of the feilds of coding, the 3 divisions that interest me the most are:
 ### Open Source
 It feels amazing when one is trying to solve a real world problem. In my case, it is the collaboration, the team work and specially the community is what makes me go towadrs it. Everytime you go for an opensource contribution, you learn something new.
 ### Competitive Coding
 I enjoy thinking on how to translate a math problem in computer language and then write code to sovle it. The best part of it is that i get to compete with my friends and this competition makes me write better and efficient code with every contest I participate in. The different types of problems that I encounter during contests, gives me better insight and develops a new way of thinking in me.
 ### Web Development
 Creating an interactive and user-freindly website, has always interested me. Although I have made a few simple web pages using my basic knowledhe of Java script and HTML, I want to improve my skills, and learn new languages like RUBY, Perl, etc.

 As I am a curious beginner in coding, I don't have much notable achievement in these fields till now. But, I beleive that utilizing the interactive coding culture and opportuninties provided by the coding club, I will surely achieve many in the coming future :)
