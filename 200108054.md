### Something about myself
Hello world !! This is Suryansh Shrivastava (IITG 2020 Fresher). I have been a tech enthusiast for as long as I can remember. I have great interest in the CP and ML modules of the Coding club. In the past i have been engaged in CP ( Qualified  Round 1 of GCJ in 2018, Was Ranked 13th in Overnite-Organized by Kshitij 2020 the Techno Management Fest of IIT KGP  ). Due to JEE I took a break from CP and I am trying to get back my flow currently.
In the recent few years I have developed interest in the fields of AI, ML, DL etc. and to feed my curiosity I am recently undertaking the ML course offered by Stanford University o n Coursera ( Instructed By Andrew NG). 
I look forward to grow myself in these areas. :)
